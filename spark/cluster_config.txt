cluster config:
10 nodes
16 cores per node
64 GB RAM per node
 
max allowed CPU cores for each executors = 5
 
leave one core per node for yarn deamon process, now the nbr of cores  per node = 16-1 = 15
 
nbr of executors per node =  15/5 = 3
nbr of executors for 10 node = 3* 10 = 30
 
leave one executor for application mater, so nbr of executors = 30 -1  = 29
 
available memory per executor = 64/3 = 21
 
heap overhead memory = 7% => 7% of 21GB = 3 GB
 
executor memory = 21- 3 = 18GB
